## üéØ What Blockchain Bouncer Does

Blockchain Bouncer verifies NFT ownership credentials for the [VIP Club Pass collection](https://thirdweb.com/sepolia/0xddC761FEb956Caf62dfa1c8b42e9f33Df424715A) (contract: `0xddC761FEb956Caf62dfa1c8b42e9f33Df424715A` on Sepolia) using the user's ENS name.

The agent's primary goals are to:
1. Obtain the user's ENS name
2. Verify ownership of NFTs from the VIP Club Pass collection
3. Grant or deny access based on NFT ownership verification

## üîß Technical Components

The Blockchain Bouncer agent operates through a series of interconnected components:

1. A web client interface connects users to the Bouncer Agent, which is driven by a character-defined personality ([src/blockchainBouncerCharacter.ts](src/blockchainBouncerCharacter.ts)) which is initialized in the [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) file.

2. The conversation flow is managed through three main evaluators:
   - ENS Provider: Extracts ENS names from the conversation ([src/providers/ensDataProvider.ts](src/providers/ensDataProvider.ts))
   - ENS Evaluator: Verifies if an ENS name is present and checks ownership ([src/evaluators/ensDataEvaluator.ts](src/evaluators/ensDataEvaluator.ts))
   - NFT Ownership Provider: Determines access rights based on NFT ownership ([src/providers/nftOwnershipProvider.ts](src/providers/nftOwnershipProvider.ts))

3. Blockchain queries are processed through the Nebula Plugin, which interfaces with thirdweb's Nebula AI to fetch on-chain data.

```

### Changing VIP Club Pass NFT Collection

1. Change the Nebula API query in the `src/evaluators/ensDataEvaluator.ts` file to use your own VIP Club Pass NFT Collection:

```typescript
const result = await blockchainService.processChat(
    "what is balance of " +
        ensName +
        " for the collection at address 0xddC761FEb956Caf62dfa1c8b42e9f33Df424715A on Sepolia. \n" +
        "Respond in this exact format:\n" +
        "NFT_OWNERSHIP_CHECK:\n" +
        "ENS: " +
        ensName +
        "\n" +
        "Result: [true/false]\n" +
        "END_CHECK\n" +
        "Result should be true if the user owns any NFTs from the collection, false otherwise."
);
```

2. Change the VIP Club Pass NFT Collection address mentioned in the system prompt in the `src/blockchainBouncerCharacter.ts` file:

```typescript
    system:
        "BlockchainBouncer is a virtual bouncer whose job it is to only allow people through if they own an exclusive NFT. " +
        "Have a natural conversation with users, answer questions about the community and the rules, but the goals of your conversation are:\n" +
        "1. get the user's ENS name\n" +
        "2. ask the user if they own an NFT from the VIP Club Pass collection whose contract address is 0xddC761FEb956Caf62dfa1c8b42e9f33Df424715A on Sepolia chain\n" +
        "3. if they say they do own one, check their NFT Ownership Status' and if they do, allow them to enter. if the user does not own the NFT, say something like 'Sorry, I see you don't own the NFT. You may not enter'",
```

2. **Advanced Thin Floor Detection**:
   - Rate-limited API requests to avoid throttling
   - Rarity analysis to find rare NFTs at discount prices
   - Customizable discount thresholds and result limits
   - Risk assessment to skip collections with suspicious activity

3. **Optimized Floor Sweeping**:
   - Gas price optimization using Etherscan API
   - Support for batch purchasing multiple NFTs
   - Profit and ROI estimation before purchase
   - Transaction monitoring and detailed reporting

4. **Automated Monitoring**:
   - Continuous collection monitoring with configurable intervals
   - Budget management with maximum spend limits
   - Rarity-based filtering for targeted purchases
   - Automatic execution when opportunities meet criteria

### üöÄ Usage Examples

#### Detect Thin Floors

```typescript
import { detectThinFloors } from './nft/floorDetector';

const opportunities = await detectThinFloors(
  ['0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d'], // BAYC collection
  0.1, // 10% below floor price threshold
  'your-reservoir-api-key',
  'https://api.reservoir.tools',
  {
    includeRarity: true,
    maxRequestsPerSecond: 3,
    minDiscount: 8, // At least 8% discount
    maxResults: 5
  }
);

console.log(`Found ${opportunities.length} opportunities`);
```

#### Sweep Floor (Buy NFTs)

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { sweepFloor } from './nft/floorDetector';

// Set up provider and signer
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('your-rpc-url');
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet('your-private-key', provider);

const txHashes = await sweepFloor(
  '0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d', // Collection ID
  10, // Maximum price in ETH
  wallet, // Ethers.js signer
  'your-reservoir-api-key',
  'https://api.reservoir.tools',
  {
    maxItems: 3, // Buy up to 3 NFTs
    gasMultiplier: 1.2, // Add 20% to estimated gas
    maxGasPrice: 30 // Max 30 gwei
  }
);

console.log(`Successfully purchased ${txHashes.length} NFTs`);
```

#### Auto-Sweep (Continuous Monitoring)

```typescript
import { autoSweep } from './nft/floorDetector';

const stopAutoSweep = await autoSweep(
  ['0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d'], // Collections to monitor
  10, // 10% discount threshold
  2, // Max 2 ETH per item
  5, // Max 5 ETH total spend
  wallet,
  'your-reservoir-api-key',
  'https://api.reservoir.tools',
  {
    checkIntervalMs: 120000, // Check every 2 minutes
    includeRarity: true,
    maxItemsPerSweep: 2,
    minRarityPercentile: 30 // Only top 30% rarity
  }
);

// Stop monitoring after 1 hour
setTimeout(() => {
  stopAutoSweep();
}, 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

### Running the NFT Floor Sweeper

1. Configure your environment variables in `.env` (see `src/nft/.env.example` for required variables)

2. Run the sweeper in monitoring mode:
```bash
./src/nft/run-sweeper.sh
```

3. Run the sweeper in auto-sweep mode (will automatically purchase NFTs):
```bash
./src/nft/run-sweeper.sh --auto
```
